# Algorithm:

Brute-Force implementation.

Try all the words in both orientations.

It may happen that words can no longer be added. If this happens the incomplete grid is printed.
Because some random choices are made, one can execute the code again and the grid should change.


There are no guarantees that this code is working correctly.


# How to use:


python3 crossword.py [path-to-wordlist]

The wordlist should be a file containing one word per line.
